/**
 * Consumes data produced by {@link Producer}.<T>
 *
 * <p>The producer uses this interface to notify its client when new data is ready or an error
 * occurs. Execution of the image request is structured as a sequence of Producers. Each one
 * consumes data produced by producer preceding it in the sequence.
 *
 * <p>For example decode is a producer that consumes data produced by the disk cache get producer.
 *
 * <p>The consumer is passed new intermediate results via onNewResult(isLast = false) method. Each
 * consumer should expect that one of the following methods will be called exactly once, as the very
 * last producer call:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>onNewResult(isLast = true) if producer finishes successfully with a final result
 *   <li>onFailure if producer failed to produce a final result
 *   <li>onCancellation if producer was cancelled before a final result could be created
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this interface must be thread safe, as callback methods might be called on
 * different threads.
