/**
 * The root drawable of a DraweeHierarchy.
 *
 * Root drawable has several functions:
 * <ul>
 * <li> A hierarchy always has the same instance of a root drawable. That means that internal
 * structural changes within the hierarchy don't require setting a new drawable to the view.
 * <li> Root drawable prevents intrinsic dimensions to escape the hierarchy. This in turn prevents
 * view to do any erroneous scaling based on those intrinsic dimensions, as the hierarchy is in
 * charge of all the required scaling.
 * <li> Root drawable is visibility aware. Visibility callback is used to attach the controller
 * (if not already attached) when the hierarchy needs to be drawn. This prevents photo-not-loading
 * issues in case attach event has not been called (for whatever reason). It also helps with
 * memory management as the controller will get detached if the drawable is not visible.
 * <li> Root drawable supports controller overlay, a special overlay set by the controller. Typical
 * usages are debugging, diagnostics and other cases where controller-specific overlay is required.
 * </ul>
