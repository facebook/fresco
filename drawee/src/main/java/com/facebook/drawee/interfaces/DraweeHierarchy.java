/**
 * Interface that represents a Drawee hierarchy.
 * <p> A hierarchy assembles a tree of Drawables in order to form a dynamically changeable display.
 * This is much more lightweight than the traditional Android way of nesting View objects.
 * <p> Hierarchy details are hidden for the outside world. All that's visible is the top level
 * drawable, which can be put into a view.
 * <p> Example hierarchy:
 *
 *   o FadeDrawable (top level drawable)
 *   |
 *   +--o ScaleTypeDrawable
 *   |  |
 *   |  +--o BitmapDrawable
 *   |
 *   +--o ScaleTypeDrawable
 *      |
 *      +--o BitmapDrawable
