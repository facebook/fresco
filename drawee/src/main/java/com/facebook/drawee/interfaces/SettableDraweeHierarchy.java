/**
 * Interface that represents a settable Drawee hierarchy. Hierarchy should display a placeholder
 * image until the actual image is set. In case of a failure, hierarchy can choose to display
 * a failure image.
 *
 * <p>IMPORTANT: methods of this interface are to be used by controllers ONLY!
 *
 * <p>
 * Example hierarchy:
 *
 *   o FadeDrawable (top level drawable)
 *   |
 *   +--o ScaleTypeDrawable
 *   |  |
 *   |  +--o ColorDrawable (placeholder image)
 *   |
 *   +--o ScaleTypeDrawable
 *   |  |
 *   |  +--o BitmapDrawable (failure image)
 *   |
 *   +--o ScaleTypeDrawable
 *      |
 *      +--o SettableDrawable
 *         |
 *         +--o BitmapDrawable (actual image)
 *
 *   SettableDraweeHierarchy in the given example has a FadeDrawable as its top level drawable.
 *   Top level drawable can be immediately put into view. Once the actual image is ready, it will
 *   be set to the hierarchy's SettableDrawable and fade animation between the placeholder and the
 *   actual image will be initiated. In case of failure, hierarchy will switch to failure image.
 *   All image branches are wrapped with ScaleType drawable which allows separate scale type to be
 *   applied on each.
 *
