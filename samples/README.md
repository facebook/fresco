# How to run the sample apps

In Android Studio, choose `File > Open..`. and select the `fresco` folder.

## Specify a path to the NDK

Fresco uses native code for a few features. To build Fresco you'll need to specify the path to the NDK.

In Android Studio, go to `File > Project Structure` and in the dialog set the `Android NDK location`. Android Studio stores the NDK location in to your `local.properties` file.

## Run a sample app

The Showcase app is probably the best one to get started with. Select the Showcase app and click run:
